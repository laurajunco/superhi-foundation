## 1. What is the World Wide Web?

- All websites are made using only 3 front-end languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- 1989 the World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners Lee: an open platform to be able to share information easily and locate it from anywhere

The web is made up of three key things:

1. **HTML**: describes content and its nature
2. **URLs**: address to uniquely identify websites and files on the web
3. **HTTP**: communication between server and client. 

-  The internet existed before the web, It has been around since the 60s. Includes: emails, the web, apps, the cloud, internet of things. 


#### Making websites:

- **HTML**: describes the content on a website. 
- **CSS**: describes how content should look on the page

- All html content is organized into boxes

HTML is made up of 4 things

1. **Tags**: < h1 > has an opening and a closing tag < / h1 >
2. **Content**: < h1 > contents inside tags < / h1 >
3. **Comments**: text inside code that wont display on the browser
4. **Attributes**: describe certain parts of the page with a bit of more information. the go in the opening tag.

- There are about 100 tags (for all kinds of content) but usually you use about 15.
