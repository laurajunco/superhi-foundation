## Week 3

### Header and hero section html
- div tags are generic html elements used for structure
- In earlier html everything was divs

- Good range for body text is 14 to 20px


### floats
- Float property was designed  for having an image inside some text
- Text would wrap around said image
- When using float the elements get taken out of the regular flow of the page
- In doing that the parent element has no awareness of them being inside them.
- we need to force the header to recognize its inside floating elements
- Using overflow: hidden makes the parent container recognize its child floating elements size.

### background images
- background-size: cover = image takes full width and height of container


### percentage values
- By using a percentage value the size of the element is going to be relative to whatever container it's inside of.

- Ellipsis caracter … (alt + l)


### html entities
- &copy; allows to put symbols and icons inside html


### centering images
- you can also use text-align: center;


### minimun size screen is usually no less than 320px
