## Week 2

### Overview and initial html

-  It is possible to have an < h1 > tag with an image inside of it
- < nav > tag: for navigation links
- h1 is best used for the primary heading on the page. There are 6 heading tags in total.

**svg**: vector format for the web. You can increase the size of image without losing quality. Files are very small, made by sets of instrutions.

### Padding, margins and the box model

- background images by default tile themselves.
- by using auto margins the content is automatically centered.
- Margins: create space on the outside of elements.
- Padding: create space on the inside of elements.

**line height**: for larger font sizes the rule of thumb is to decrease the line height a bit. 1.3 - 1.6 is generally good.

### Blockquotes and borders

- borders go outside of padding but inside of the box.
